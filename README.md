# Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset

The Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset examines toothpaste prices and availabilty in Downtown Vancouver and surrounding areas.

The dataset includes 111 unique toothpaste products from three major brands (Colgate, Crest, and Sensodyne). Subsequently, there are 12 unique toothpase subbrands (Colgate: Enamel Health, MaxFresh, Optic White, Sensitive, Sensitive Pro-Relief, Total; Crest: 3D White, Complete, Pro-Health, Sensi; Sensodyne: Complete, Pronamel) targeting specific oral health concerns. 

Each toothpaste is broken into its component pieces: master brand, subbrand,product name and product size. For example, Crest 3D White Arctic Fresh 135 would have Crest as the master brand, 3D White for a subbrand, Arctic Fresh as the product name and 130ml as the package size. When product size differences are introduced, our dataset grows to 155 unique products. 

Also included is a matrix of functional claims for each of the 112 different toothpastes sold by the major three toothpaste companies in Downtown Vancouver.
