# Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset

The Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset examines toothpaste price and availability in Downtown Vancouver and surrounding areas.

The dataset includes over 100 unique toothpaste products from three(3) major brands (Colgate, Crest, and Sensodyne). Subsequently, there are 12 toothpaste sub-brands (Colgate: Enamel Health, MaxFresh, Optic White, Sensitive, Sensitive Pro-Relief, Total; Crest: 3D White, Complete, Pro-Health, Sensi; Sensodyne: Complete, Pronamel) targeting specific oral health concerns. 

Each toothpaste is broken into its component pieces: master brand, sub-brand, product name and product size. For example, Crest 3D White Arctic Fresh 135 would have Crest as the master brand, 3D White for a sub-brand, Arctic Fresh as the product name and 130ml as the package size. When product size differences are introduced, our dataset grows to over 150 unique products. 

** To be included is a matrix of functional claims for each of the different toothpastes sold by the major three toothpaste companies in Downtown Vancouver.

## Sample Collection Methodology.
At points of convenience, starting in January 2018 and extending until January 2019, photographs were taken of toothpaste aisles in drug stores and supermarkets to capture product availability, regular price, sale price and conditions of sale. The data was inputted manually from these images into spreadsheets.
