# Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset

The Vancouver Toothpaste Dataset examines toothpaste prices and availabilty in the Downtown core and surrounding areas.



The dataset includes XX(0+) unique toothpaste products from three major brands (Colgate, Crest, and Sensodyne). 

Each toothpaste is broken into its component pieces: master brand, subbrand, product name and product size. For example, Crest 3D White Arctic Fresh would have Crest as the master brand, 3D White for a subbrand, Arctice Fresh 
Additionally, I have attempted to complete matrix of functional claims for each othe the toothpastes.
